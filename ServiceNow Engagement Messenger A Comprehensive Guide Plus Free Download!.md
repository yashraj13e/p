*   **Web Chat:** Engage visitors on your website in real-time.
*   **Mobile App:** Provide support within your native mobile applications.
*   **Social Media:** Connect with customers on platforms like Facebook and Twitter.
*   **SMS:** Communicate via text messaging.

At its core, Engagement Messenger aims to provide a consistent and connected experience for both customers and agents. It bridges the gap between different communication channels, ensuring that conversations are tracked and managed effectively.

## Key Features and Capabilities

Engagement Messenger is packed with features designed to enhance customer engagement and improve agent productivity. Some of the most important capabilities include:

*   **Unified Agent Workspace:** Agents can manage conversations from all channels within a single, intuitive workspace. This eliminates the need to switch between different applications, saving time and reducing frustration.
*   **Contextual Information:** When a customer initiates a conversation, Engagement Messenger automatically pulls relevant information from ServiceNow, such as their profile, purchase history, and previous interactions. This context empowers agents to provide personalized and efficient support.
*   **AI-Powered Chatbots:** Integrate chatbots to handle common inquiries and automate repetitive tasks. Chatbots can answer frequently asked questions, guide customers through self-service options, and escalate complex issues to human agents.
*   **Intelligent Routing:** Engagement Messenger uses intelligent routing rules to direct conversations to the most appropriate agent based on factors like skillset, availability, and customer history. This ensures that customers are always connected with the best possible resource.
*   **Proactive Engagement:** Reach out to customers proactively based on their behavior or profile. For example, you can send a personalized message to a website visitor who has spent a certain amount of time browsing a particular product page.
*   **Analytics and Reporting:** Track key metrics such as conversation volume, resolution time, and customer satisfaction. These insights can help you identify areas for improvement and optimize your customer engagement strategy.
*   **Integration with ServiceNow Platform:** Engagement Messenger seamlessly integrates with other ServiceNow modules, such as ITSM, CSM, and HR Service Delivery. This allows you to leverage the full power of the ServiceNow platform to deliver a holistic customer experience.

*   **Knowledge Base Integration:** Allow agents (and chatbots) to quickly access and share relevant knowledge base articles with customers. This empowers customers to find answers to their questions independently and reduces the need for agent intervention.
*   **File Sharing:** Enable agents to share files with customers and vice-versa. This is useful for sharing documents, screenshots, and other relevant information.
*   **Screen Sharing:** Allow agents to remotely view a customer's screen to provide more effective support. This can be particularly helpful for troubleshooting technical issues.
*   **Co-browsing:** Enable agents to interact with a customer's browser in real-time. This allows agents to guide customers through complex processes and provide step-by-step assistance.
*   **Surveys and Feedback:** Collect customer feedback after each interaction to gauge satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
*   **Security and Compliance:** Engagement Messenger is built on the ServiceNow platform, which provides robust security and compliance features. This ensures that customer data is protected and that you meet all relevant regulatory requirements.
