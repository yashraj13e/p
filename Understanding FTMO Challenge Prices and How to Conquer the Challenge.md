## What is the FTMO Challenge?

The FTMO Challenge is a two-step evaluation process designed to identify skilled and disciplined traders. Aspiring FTMO Traders must pass the Challenge (Step 1) and the Verification (Step 2) to demonstrate their ability to manage risk and generate consistent profits. Upon successful completion, traders become FTMO Traders and gain access to a funded account ranging from $10,000 to $200,000 (depending on the chosen account size) and receive up to 90% of the profits generated.

The Challenge involves adhering to specific trading objectives, including profit targets, maximum daily loss limits, and maximum overall loss limits.  These rules are in place to simulate the pressures of real-world trading and ensure that only traders with sound risk management strategies succeed.
