## The Genesis of People Analytics: Project Oxygen and Beyond

Google's journey into people analytics began with a pivotal project known as **Project Oxygen**. Frustrated with the prevailing belief that managers were unnecessary, Google decided to put the hypothesis to the test. They analyzed performance reviews, employee surveys, and other internal data to identify the key traits of effective managers. The results were surprising: good managers were crucial to team performance and employee satisfaction.

Project Oxygen identified eight key behaviors of high-performing Google managers:

1.  Being a good coach
2.  Empowering the team and not micromanaging
3.  Expressing interest in team members’ success and well-being
4.  Being productive and results-oriented
5.  Being a good communicator and listening to the team
6.  Helping employees with career development
7.  Having a clear vision and strategy for the team
8.  Having key technical skills so they can advise the team

These findings not only validated the importance of managers but also provided a clear framework for manager training and development. Project Oxygen became a cornerstone of Google's management philosophy and a powerful demonstration of the potential of people analytics.

Following Project Oxygen, Google continued to invest in and expand its people analytics capabilities, launching projects like **Project Aristotle**, which aimed to understand what makes a team effective. Through rigorous data analysis, Project Aristotle found that **psychological safety** – the ability to take risks and voice opinions without fear of judgment – was the single most important factor in team success. This discovery led to changes in team dynamics and management practices across the company.
