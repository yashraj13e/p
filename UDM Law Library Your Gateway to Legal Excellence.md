## A Guide to Effective Legal Research

While the UDM Law Library provides an array of resources and support, understanding fundamental legal research strategies is key. Here's a concise guide:

1.  **Identify the Legal Issue:** Clearly define the legal question you need to answer.
2.  **Consult Secondary Sources:** Begin with secondary sources like legal encyclopedias (e.g., American Jurisprudence, Corpus Juris Secundum), treatises, and law review articles to gain a general understanding of the legal issue and identify relevant primary sources.
3.  **Locate Primary Authority:** Primary authority includes constitutions, statutes, case law, and administrative regulations. Use legal databases (LexisNexis, Westlaw, Bloomberg Law) to find relevant cases and statutes.
4.  **Analyze and Synthesize Authority:** Carefully read and analyze the primary authority you find. Determine whether it is binding or persuasive authority. Synthesize the relevant authority to develop a coherent legal argument.
5.  **Update Your Research:** Always update your research to ensure that the authority you are relying on is still good law. Use citators like KeyCite (Westlaw) or Shepard's (LexisNexis) to check the validity of cases and statutes.
6.  **Document Your Research:** Keep meticulous records of your research process, including the sources you consulted, the search terms you used, and the results you found. This will help you to avoid duplicating your efforts and to track down sources later.
