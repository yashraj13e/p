## Factors Influencing Qualys VMDR Pricing

Qualys VMDR pricing is generally based on a subscription model, and several factors can affect the final cost:

1.  **Number of Assets:** This is typically the primary driver of cost. Assets can include servers, workstations, virtual machines, cloud instances, containers, and other devices connected to your network. The more assets you need to monitor, the higher the subscription fee. Qualys offers various licensing options based on asset count, so you can choose the tier that best fits your organization's size.

2.  **Modules Included:** VMDR is a comprehensive platform that encompasses various modules beyond basic vulnerability scanning. These modules may include:

    *   **Vulnerability Management (VM):** The core module for identifying and assessing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Threat Protection (TP):** Provides threat intelligence and context to prioritize vulnerabilities based on real-world threats.
    *   **Detection and Response (DR):** Enables automated response actions to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.
    *   **Cloud Agent:** Allows continuous vulnerability assessment of endpoints, even when they are not on the corporate network.
    *   **Container Security:** Specifically designed for securing containerized environments.
    *   **Web Application Scanning (WAS):** Scans web applications for vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

    The more modules you choose to include in your VMDR subscription, the higher the overall cost will be.

3.  **Subscription Term:** Qualys typically offers subscription terms ranging from one to three years. Longer subscription terms may come with discounts, so it's worth exploring these options to potentially lower the overall cost.

4.  **Level of Support:** Qualys offers different levels of support, ranging from standard support to premium support with dedicated account managers and faster response times. The level of support you choose will impact the subscription price.

5.  **Deployment Model:** Qualys VMDR can be deployed in different ways, including:

    *   **Cloud-Based:** Qualys hosts the platform in its cloud infrastructure. This is the most common deployment model and offers scalability and ease of management.
    *   **On-Premises:** You deploy Qualys VMDR on your own infrastructure. This option may be preferred by organizations with strict compliance requirements or specific data residency needs.
    *   **Hybrid:** A combination of cloud-based and on-premises deployment.

    The deployment model can influence the pricing, especially if you choose the on-premises option, as it may require additional hardware and software costs.

6.  **Geographic Location:** In some cases, pricing may vary based on your geographic location due to factors like regional discounts or currency exchange rates.
