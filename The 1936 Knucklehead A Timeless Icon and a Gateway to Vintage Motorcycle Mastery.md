## A Revolution in Design and Engineering

Before the Knucklehead, Harley-Davidson's overhead valve engines were prone to overheating and reliability issues.  The introduction of the "Knucklehead" – so named for the distinct shape of its rocker boxes that resembled a clenched fist – represented a significant leap forward in engine design.  It was the first Harley-Davidson to feature overhead valves in a V-twin configuration, improving airflow, combustion efficiency, and ultimately, power output.

Key features of the 1936 Knucklehead included:

*   **Overhead Valve V-Twin Engine:**  This was the heart of the revolution. The overhead valve design allowed for more efficient intake and exhaust, leading to increased horsepower and torque.  The initial displacement was 61 cubic inches (1000cc), later increased to 74 cubic inches (1200cc).
*   **Improved Lubrication System:**  The Knucklehead featured a recirculating oil system, a vast improvement over previous total-loss systems. This meant better engine cooling and reduced wear, contributing to improved reliability.
*   **Four-Speed Transmission:** A robust four-speed transmission offered a wider range of gear ratios, making the bike more versatile for different riding conditions.
*   **Styling:** The Knucklehead's art deco-inspired styling was a significant departure from the utilitarian designs of earlier Harley-Davidsons.  The sleek, flowing lines, chrome accents, and distinctive tank badges gave the bike a sophisticated and modern look.
