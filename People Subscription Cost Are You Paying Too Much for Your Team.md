## Calculating and Analyzing People Subscription Cost

Calculating and analyzing these costs is essential for effective management. There are several key metrics you can use:

*   **Embrace Flexible Work Arrangements:** Offer flexible work arrangements, such as remote work and flexible hours. This can reduce overhead costs and improve employee satisfaction.
*   **Outsource Non-Core Functions:** Consider outsourcing non-core functions, such as payroll, HR, and IT. This can free up internal resources and reduce costs.
